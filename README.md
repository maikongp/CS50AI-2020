# CS50AI-2020
This repository contains all projects developed on CS50AI Harvard course.

- Degrees: Using an IMDb database, a csv file that contains a list of movies and actors who starred them, the program determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are. Problem based on Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game. Project preview on https://youtu.be/ikSYv2R_cHk

- Tictactoe: The program uses the minimax algorithm to implement an IA to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Project preview: https://youtu.be/w-ZByJph0D8

- Knights: Using the propositional logic, the program tries to solve the puzzle where given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character is a knight or a knave. Project preview: https://youtu.be/-ea-qvpuX84

- Minesweeper: Using the propositional logic, the program implement an IA to play the minesweeper game, that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.” Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell (i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine.
